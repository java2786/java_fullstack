1. Variables and Data Types
    - Declare variables to store your name, age, and favorite hobby. Print them in a sentence (e.g., "My name is John, I am 20 years old, and I like painting.").
    - Create a variable to store a number and check whether it is even or odd.
    - Declare a constant to store the value of Pi and use it to calculate the circumference and area of a circle given its radius.
    - Write a program to calculate the area of a rectangle (length × breadth) using variables.

2. Operators
    - Write a program that calculates the sum, difference, product, and division of two numbers.
    - Check whether a number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
    - Write a program to find the square and cube of a number using arithmetic operators.
    - Use the increment (++) and decrement (--) operators to print the next and previous numbers of a given number.
    - Create a program to calculate the simple interest using the formula:
    - Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100.

3. Conditional Statements
    - Write a program to check whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero.
    - Store the user's age in a variable and print whether the user is eligible to vote (age ≥ 18).
    - Write a program to check whether a character is a vowel or a consonant.    
    - Create a program that accepts three numbers and prints the largest among them.
    - Write a program to calculate the grade of a student based on marks:
        90 and above: Grade A
        80-89: Grade B
        70-79: Grade C
        60-69: Grade D
        Below 60: Fail

4. Loops
    - Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10 using a loop.
    - Create a program that prints the multiplication table of a number entered by the user.
    - Print all even numbers between 1 and 50 using a loop.
    - Write a program to calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number.
    - Create a program to print this pattern using nested loops:
        *
        * *
        * * *
        * * * *
        * * * * *


5. Combined Concepts (Variables, Loops, Conditions, Operators)
    - Write a program to find the factorial of a number.
    - Create a program that checks whether a number is a palindrome (e.g., 121 is a palindrome, but 123 is not).
    - Write a program to count the number of vowels in a given string.
    - Create a program to reverse a given number (e.g., 12345 → 54321).
    - Write a program to check whether a number is prime or not.

6. Arrays (Introduction to Collections)
    - Write a program to store 5 names in an array and print each name using a loop.
    - Create a program to find the largest and smallest numbers in an array.
    - Write a program to calculate the sum of all numbers in an array.
    - Create a program to reverse an array.
    - Check if a given number exists in an array (e.g., if the number is 7 in [1, 3, 7, 9, 11]).

7. Fun/Creative Problems
    - Create a program that simulates a dice roll (random number between 1 and 6).
    - Write a program to print the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.
    - Create a program that counts how many times a specific character appears in a string. // count("a", "javascript")
    - Write a program to simulate a basic calculator (add, subtract, multiply, divide). // write on a singel function  -> calculate("+", 15, 6)
